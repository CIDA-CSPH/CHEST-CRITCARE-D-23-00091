We evaluated the association between PEth (log-scale) and AUDIT-C, stratified by pandemic phase, using multiply-imputed datasets and Pearson correlation.

### Using multiple imputation (MI)

Using multiply-imputed data from the entire cohort, log-transformed PEth measures were correlated with AUDIT-C scores berfore the pandemic (Pearson’s rho=**0.58**, p<0.01), and during the pandemic (Pearson's rho=**0.28**, p=0.009). Correlations were significantly different between pandemic eras (p-value: **0.0011**).

### Complete-case (CC) analysis

Using complete cases from the entire cohort, log-transformed PEth measures were correlated with AUDIT-C scores berfore the pandemic (Pearson’s rho=**0.72**, p<0.01), and during the pandemic (Pearson's rho=**0.27**, p=0.016). Correlations were significantly different between pandemic eras (p-value: **< 0.001**).

## New Analysis: Sensitivity/Specificity of AUDIT-C

We treated binarized PEth values (≥25 ng/mL) as the gold-standard predictor of alcohol misuse. We then compared the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of AUDIT-C as a diagnostic screener for alcohol misuse, both before and during the pandemic. The cut-point for AUDIT-C was ≥4 for males and ≥3 for females.

Since datasets were multiply imputed, we aggregated results by assuming each operating characteristic (e.g. sensitivity) was normally distributed with standard error:

$$
SE(\hat{p})=\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}
$$
where $\hat{p}$ was the estimated value of the operating characteristic on a single imputed dataset. Using Rubin's rule (1987) for mutliply imputed data, we summarized the point estimate for each operating characteristic, as well as the 95% confidence interval.

```{r}
tab_sens_spec %>%
  kable(table.attr='data-quarto-disable-processing="true"') %>% 
  kable_minimal(full_width=F)
```

During the pandemic, both the specificity and PPV of AUDIT-C improved, though the confidence intervals for wpecificity were overlapping across pandemic eras. The improvement in PPV was driven, at least in part, by greater prevalence of high PEth during the pandemic.

Sensitivity of AUDIT-C declined from 0.458 to 0.172. Thus, AUDIT-C was less likely to identify alcohol users (i.e., those who had high PEth), during the pandemic.

Similarly, negative predicted value (NPV) declined from 0.679 to 0.127 during the pandemic, meaning a large proportion of those with low AUDIT-C also had high PEth and went undetected.

> The above estimates are the effects of alcohol misuse defined by PEth. PEth < 20 ng/mL was considered “light or no consumption” (i.e. abstinence to < 2 drinks/day, several days per week), and served as the referent group. Patients with PEth 20-199 ng/mL was considered “significant consumption” (i.e. consuming 2-4 drinks/day, several days per week). Patients with PEth ≥ 200 ng/mL was considered “heavy consumption”, (i.e. consuming at least 4 drinks/day, several days per week). Adjusted effects were estimated from models with covariates including: age, sex, race, ethnicity, APACHE II, diabetes, cirrhosis, current smoking, and COVID status. OR is the odds ratio (with 95% confidence interval) of having higher values of the outcome (e.g., the odds ratio of staying on a ventilator for a greater number of days). PEth results were pooled from five multiply imputed datasets to categorize patients as alcohol misuse versus no alcohol misuse at the 25 ng/mL threshold.
